# Player! V1.1

Player! is a five button macropad originally designed to accomodate changing music settings whilst using a different program in Spotify; without tabbing out of the current window. By default it is programmed to use the built-in media keys in Windows, which can be further optimised with global hotkeys using [Toastify](https://github.com/aleab/toastify).

Using four cherry switches, Player! provides dedicated keys for pausing/playing music -  returning to a previous song, and skipping to the next song. The fourth switch remains user programmable, binded to 'insert' by default to be used as dedicated Discord mute key. A rotary encoder allows for volume control, with a toggle function bound to its embedded switch for rewinding and fast-forwarding music.
